  id: canary_deployment
  description: Canary deployment is a deployment strategy that consists of having
    a replica of the production environment. New software versions are deployed to
    this replica, and after deployment, the release of the new version is done gradually,
    directing a percentage of user requests to the environment containing this new
    version. To perform this gradual switching, a load balancer, for example, can
    be used. To better understand canary deployment, imagine you have a restaurant
    and want to launch a new dish on the menu. However, instead of offering this new
    dish to all customers, you select only a small group of customers to whom the
    dish will be offered and test how they will react to the dish. If the feedback
    is positive, you can start offering the new dish to a larger group of customers,
    until the dish is actually launched on the menu for all of them.

  id: cli
  description: A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way to interact with computer programs
    where you type commands instead of clicking buttons or using menus. There are
    different ways to use software, such as the graphical interface (GUI), which is
    the one we see with images and buttons, or through APIs, which allow other programs
    to communicate with the software. An example of software that can be used in various
    ways is GitHub, which can be accessed through a browser, a desktop application,
    or through the terminal, using the command line (CLI).

  id: code_review
  description: "It is a good practice that is highly recommended for the systems development
    process, through which the team's developers help each other. Normally, after
    the development stage of each task is completed, before the code is made available
    for testing, the team evaluates what was done and makes suggestions on what can
    be improved, when necessary. This brings several benefits. Some of them are: improving
    the technical side of the team, improving development, code quality, team integration,
    everyone knows what is being developed, among others."

  tags:
    - Concept
  id: code_smells
  description: Code smells are indicators of potential problems in the code that,
    while they do not cause immediate errors or prevent the software from working,
    can suggest areas of risk that could lead to future difficulties in maintaining
    and evolving the code. They often point to design issues, duplication, complexity,
    or lack of clarity that can make the code more difficult to understand, modify,
    or extend.
- title: Commit

    - Concept
  id: commit
  description: When we work with code versioning (which is highly recommended), the
    word commit is quite common among developers. But this word is also used by those
    who work with databases. When there is a set of changes made to a code, the person
    executes the commit command that saves what was done within the project. There
    is also the semantic commit, which means that this set of changes must have a
    meaning for the project. The commit also serves to finalize a transaction within
    a database management system, making the changes visible. This transaction will
    normally start with the begin command and end with the commit command.

  description: A component is a fundamental, reusable unit of user interface construction.
    It encapsulates the logic and presentation related to a specific part of the interface.
    Components can be compared to building blocks that, when combined, form complex
    interfaces. They promote code organization and maintainability, since they can
    be developed and tested independently. Components can accept properties (props)
    as input and render information based on those data, allowing for flexible customization.

  id: continuous_delivery
  description: Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice that ensures
    that the code is always ready to be deployed to production at any time. After
    Continuous Integration (CI), the software is automatically prepared for releases,
    with an automated deployment process and rigorous tests that ensure its quality.
    The benefits of CD include faster deployments, reduced risks, and continuous feedback
    from end users. Tools such as Spinnaker and Octopus Deploy are commonly used to
    facilitate this practice.

  id: curl
  description: Tool for transferring data to/from a server, i.e. making a request
    using various protocols, the most common being HTTP. When you hear the term 'make
    a curl for x' it means that you need to make a request for x, but not necessarily
    using the curl tool. Curl is widely used because it is simple to use via the command
    line (terminal), not requiring third-party software to make calls.
