  description: It is a computer program that simulates a human being in a conversation
    through text or voice messages, widely used to automate repetitive tasks and provide
    support and assistance to users. Chatbots can be used in a wide variety of applications,
    such as customer service, virtual assistants, among others.
- title: Class
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: A class, in software development, is like a template and a "model"
    for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions)
    that objects created from it will have. They help organize code, allowing reuse
    and abstraction of data and functionality into a coherent structure.
- title: Clone
  tags:
  - Concept
  - Versioning
  description: Cloning a repository is like taking a local copy of that project into
    your own workspace. It's like having your own version of the code to tinker with
    as you please. This allows you to work on a local version of the code, make changes,
    and contribute back to the main project when you're ready.
- title: Cloud Computing
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: Generally speaking, it refers to the use of computer services, such
    as file storage and program execution, over the Internet. This means that you
    do not need physical equipment, as everything is done online. You can access your
    data and programs from anywhere, at any time, without worrying about maintaining
    physical equipment.
- title: CMD
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: The CMD (short for "Command Prompt") is a command-line interface present
    in the Windows operating system. It allows users to interact directly with the
    system using text commands, instead of a graphical interface (GUI). In CMD, you
    can perform a series of tasks and commands directly, such as navigating directories,
    manipulating files, configuring the system, and running programs. Its main concepts
    are command line and prompt. The command line is where you type the commands.
    Unlike a graphical interface, where you click on icons and buttons, in the command
    line, you write instructions that the computer executes directly. The prompt refers
    to the initial screen where you start typing the commands.
- title: Code Review
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: 'It is a good practice that is highly recommended for the systems development
    process, through which the team''s developers help each other. Normally, after
    the development stage of each task is completed, before the code is made available
    for testing, the team evaluates what was done and makes suggestions on what can
    be improved, when necessary. This brings several benefits. Some of them are: improving
    the technical side of the team, improving development, code quality, team integration,
    everyone knows what is being developed, among others.'
- title: Code Smells
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: Code smells are indicators of potential problems in the code that,
    while they do not cause immediate errors or prevent the software from working,
    can suggest areas of risk that could lead to future difficulties in maintaining
    and evolving the code. They often point to design issues, duplication, complexity,
    or lack of clarity that can make the code more difficult to understand, modify,
    or extend.
- title: Commit
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: When we work with code versioning (which is highly recommended), the
    word commit is quite common among developers. But this word is also used by those
    who work with databases. When there is a set of changes made to a code, the person
    executes the commit command that saves what was done within the project. There
    is also the semantic commit, which means that this set of changes must have a
    meaning for the project. The commit also serves to finalize a transaction within
    a database management system, making the changes visible. This transaction will
    normally start with the begin command and end with the commit command.
- title: Component
  tags:
  - Concept
  - Design
  description: A component is a fundamental, reusable unit of user interface construction.
    It encapsulates the logic and presentation related to a specific part of the interface.
    Components can be compared to building blocks that, when combined, form complex
    interfaces. They promote code organization and maintainability, since they can
    be developed and tested independently. Components can accept properties (props)
    as input and render information based on those data, allowing for flexible customization.
- title: Computed variable
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: It is a variable that does not store a value directly, it calculates
    or derives its value from other variables or data.
- title: Computer Vision
  tags:
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Concept
  description: It is a field of artificial intelligence that studies how computers
    can obtain and process information from visual stimuli. It focuses on developing
    systems that can analyze and understand images and videos, allowing computers
    to recognize objects, people, places, movements, and other visual elements. Computer
    vision (CV) is used in a wide variety of applications, such as facial recognition,
    self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, among others.
- title: Continuous Delivery
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice that ensures
    that the code is always ready to be deployed to production at any time. After
    Continuous Integration (CI), the software is automatically prepared for releases,
    with an automated deployment process and rigorous tests that ensure its quality.
    The benefits of CD include faster deployments, reduced risks, and continuous feedback
    from end users. Tools such as Spinnaker and Octopus Deploy are commonly used to
    facilitate this practice.
- title: Continuous Integration
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: Continuous integration is the practice of frequently testing the parts
    of the code that are added to a project. This prevents bugs and errors from being
    added, efficiently performing specific tests that verify the integration of each
    part.
- title: Convolutional Neural Network
  tags:
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Concept
  - Neural network
  description: It is a type of artificial neural network that uses a mathematical
    operation called convolution in one or more of its layers. A Convolutional Neural
    Network or CNN is often used to process input data that has a matrix structure,
    such as images, and is widely used in computer vision applications, such as image
    and video recognition.
- title: CORS
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a security policy for websites. It
    determines how resources on a web page can be accessed by another page on a different
    domain. For example, an image or CSS file can usually be shared between different
    sites without problems, but JavaScript code often has stricter restrictions.
- title: CSS
  tags:
  - Front-end
  description: Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism for adding styles to a web page
    such as colors, sizes, fonts, etc. It is possible to link the HTML file to the
    CSS by adding a link to a CSS file that contains the styles.
- title: CSS Preprocessors
  tags:
  - Front-end
  description: 'CSS preprocessors are like special tools that make styling a website
    easier. They make it possible to create more complicated styles that can be reused
    in different parts of the site. Think of them as smarter ways of choosing colors
    and fonts to make a website look good and work. Examples: SASS/SCSS and LESS.'
- title: Curl
  tags:
  - Tool
  description: Tool for transferring data to/from a server, i.e. making a request
    using various protocols, the most common being HTTP. When you hear the term 'make
    a curl for x' it means that you need to make a request for x, but not necessarily
    using the curl tool. Curl is widely used because it is simple to use via the command
    line (terminal), not requiring third-party software to make calls.
