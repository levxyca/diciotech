  description: It is a problem setting in deep learning where, at test time, a model
    is given samples of classes that were not observed during training and needs to
    identify the class to which they belong. Unlike standard machine learning, where
    models must correctly classify new samples into classes that were already observed
    during training, in zero-shot learning no samples of the classes of the new data
    were provided during the training of the classifier. Therefore, it can be seen
    as an extreme case of domain adaptation. Zero-shot methods usually work by associating
    observed and unobserved classes through some form of auxiliary information, which
    encodes distinctive observable properties of the objects. For example, given a
    set of images of animals to be classified, along with auxiliary textual descriptions
    of what the animals look like, an artificial intelligence model that has been
    trained to recognize horses but has never seen a zebra can still recognize a zebra
    when it also knows that zebras look like striped horses.
