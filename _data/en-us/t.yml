  description:
    "The Terminal is a CLI that allows users to interact directly with
    the operating system using text commands, instead of a graphical interface (GUI).
    In the Terminal, you can perform a series of tasks and commands directly, such
    as navigating directories, manipulating files, configuring the system, and running
    programs. We can highlight terminals such as: Bash (Linux and MacOS), Zsh (Linux
    and MacOS), Fish (Linux and MacOS), CMD (Windows), and PowerShell (Windows)."

  description:
    'The ternary conditional operator is a shorthand way to make a choice
    between two options based on a condition. It works like this: if the condition
    is true, it returns the first result; if it is false, it returns the second. It''s
    like a compact version of an "if-else" in a single line.'

    code: "Expression(condition) ? True(exp1) : False(exp2);"

    - Concept
  description:
    A machine learning technique in which knowledge learned from one task
    is reused to improve performance on a related task. For example, knowledge gained
    from learning to recognize cars can be applied when trying to segment images of
    cars. In transfer learning, the model that is transferred is called the source
    model, and the model to which it is transferred is called the target model. The
    source and target tasks are different but related, and the source task is used
    to aid in learning the target task. The source and target data can be from the
    same modality (e.g., images) or from different modalities (e.g., images and text).

    - Neural network
  description:
    A type of artificial neural network that uses an encoder-decoder architecture
    to process input data. Transformer models apply a set of mathematical techniques,
    called attention or self-attention, to detect the subtle ways in which even distant
    data elements in a series influence and depend on each other. By finding patterns
    between elements mathematically, transformers eliminate the need for large, labeled
    datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. Any application that
    uses sequential data from text, images, or videos is a candidate for transformer
    models.

    "A typed variable is one that has a data type associated with it (e.g.:
    int, float, string)."
