  description:
    A tag is a markup element used in markup languages, such as HTML and
    XML, to define the structure and meaning of a document. They are used to define
    the beginning and end of an element, such as a paragraph, a table, or an image.
    Tags are written between angle brackets, such as <tag>, with the marking of the
    end of an element defined as </tag>. If an element has no other elements inside
    it (also called child elements), it can be defined only as <tag /> instead of
    <tag></tag>.
