    A honeypot is a security system configured to detect, divert, or in
    some way neutralize attempts of unauthorized use of information systems. The definition
    of honeypot comes from the world of espionage, where the spy Mata Hari uses a
    romantic relationship as a way to steal secrets. They are described as the placement
    of a "honey pot". It attracts cybercriminals as a trap, allowing administrators
    to monitor their activities and develop better defenses.

  description:
    A tag is a markup element used in markup languages, such as HTML and
    XML, to define the structure and meaning of a document. They are used to define
    the beginning and end of an element, such as a paragraph, a table, or an image.
    Tags are written between angle brackets, such as <tag>, with the marking of the
    end of an element defined as </tag>. If an element has no other elements inside
    it (also called child elements), it can be defined only as <tag /> instead of
    <tag></tag>.
