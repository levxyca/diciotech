  description: Garbage collector is a tool that helps to free up space in the computer's
    memory automatically. Imagine that, when developing a program, you use memory
    blocks to store information. Over time, some of these blocks are no longer needed.
    The garbage collector identifies these "useless" blocks and cleans them, returning
    the space for the system to use again. This is especially useful in programming
    languages such as Java, C# and JavaScript, where this process is done automatically,
    helping to avoid problems and making the computer faster.

  id: generative_adversarial_network
  description: Generative Adversarial Network or GAN is a type of artificial neural
    network composed of two competing neural networks trained in an adversarial manner.
    The generative neural network is trained to generate new data, while the discriminative
    network is trained to distinguish between real data and fake data. In this way,
    the two neural networks compete with each other, which leads to a continuous improvement
    of both and generates two specialized models, which can be used separately after
    being trained. The generative model is often used to generate new, more realistic
    images, videos, audios and texts, such as human faces, videos of people talking,
    audios of people singing and news texts. The discriminative model is commonly
    used to identify fake data.

  description: It is a type of artificial neural network that generates new data based
    on a set of training data. This data is usually variations of the input data,
    such as changes in a person's expressions in a video. It is often used to generate
    new images, videos, audios and texts, and can be used for data augmentation.

  description: GitHub is a web-based source code hosting platform that offers a variety
    of services related to version control and collaboration in software development
    (it is used in conjunction with Git). It is widely used by developers around the
    world to store, collaborate, manage, and control the source code of software projects.

  description: GitLab is a Git-based source code hosting platform that, like GitHub,
    offers integrated CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) tools
    directly. It stands out for having an "open core" policy, in which it is possible
    to access and contribute to its source code, being much more transparent than
    other platforms that keep their source code closed.

  id: gpt
  description: It is a large language model created by OpenAI. Namely Generative Pre-trained
    Transformer, it is capable of generating high-quality texts, such as news articles,
    poetry, and fiction, based on a small piece of text as input. It is one of the
    most advanced language models in the world and is capable of performing a wide
    variety of natural language tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization,
    code generation, among others. The latest versions also support other data types,
    such as images.

  id: gradient
  description: The gradient simply measures how much the output of a function changes
    if you change the inputs by a small amount. It measures the change in all the
    weights of the neural network relative to the difference in the calculated error.
    You can also think of a gradient as the slope of a function. The larger the gradient,
    the steeper the slope and the faster a model can learn. But if the slope is zero,
    the model stops learning. In mathematical terms, a gradient is a partial derivative
    with respect to its inputs.

  id: gradient_descent
  description: Neural network models are usually trained by an optimization algorithm
    that is a variation of gradient descent. During learning, input training data
    helps the model learn, and the loss function evaluates how accurate the prediction
    performance is for each iteration. As training progresses, the goal is to reduce
    the loss function/prediction error by iteratively adjusting the parameters. Specifically,
    the gradient descent algorithm has a forward pass (or forward propagation) step
    and a backward pass (or backpropagation). In the forward propagation step, the
    input data is passed through the neural network and the output is calculated.
    In the backward propagation step, the gradient of the loss function is calculated
    with respect to each weight in the neural network, and the weights are updated
    according to the gradient. The algorithm then takes a gradient descent step to
    minimize the loss function (taking into account the learning rate).

  id: gradient_explosion
  description: Exploding gradient is a problem that occurs when the gradient of a
    loss function grows exponentially during the training of a machine learning model.
    This can result in model parameters diverging to infinity, causing the learning
    process to fail. When gradients explode, weight updates during training can become
    so large that they cause the model to revert to a large error, instead of minimizing
    it with each iteration. Gradient explosion can be caused by several factors, such
    as a very high learning rate, a poorly designed loss function, among others.
