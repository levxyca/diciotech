  description:
    React is an open-source JavaScript library used to create interactive
    and dynamic user interfaces in web applications and other environments, such as
    mobile, TV, virtual reality, among others. It stands out for its component-based
    programming model and efficiency in updating the user interface, making it a popular
    choice in front-end development.

  description:
    Recurrent Neural Network or RNN is a type of artificial neural network
    that uses loops and states to process data. It is often used to process input
    data that has a sequential structure, such as text, audio, video, and time series,
    and is widely used in natural language processing applications, such as machine
    translation, speech recognition and sentiment analysis.

  description:
    Reinforcement Learning, or RL, is a type of machine learning that uses
    rewards to train a model. It is widely used to solve decision-making problems,
    where the goal is to maximize a reward. For example, a machine learning model
    can be trained to play a game, where the training dataset consists of actions
    and associated rewards.

  description:
    Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique that
    trains a reward model directly from human feedback. RLHF is used in tasks where
    it is difficult to define or measure a clear algorithmic solution, especially
    when dealing with complex tasks involving human values or preferences, but where
    humans can easily judge the quality of the model's output. For example, if the
    task is to generate a compelling story, humans can rank different AI-generated
    stories based on their quality and reject those that are inappropriate or outside
    the model's knowledge space. A famous example of a language model trained by RLHF
    is OpenAI's ChatGPT. A major challenge is the scalability and cost of human feedback,
    which can be slow and expensive to obtain compared to unsupervised learning. The
    quality and consistency of this feedback can also vary depending on the task and
    the individual preferences of humans. If the feedback is not unbiased, or is inconsistent
    or incorrect, the model can become biased.

  description:
    A Repository is basically a box that holds all of your project's material.
    Think of it as a place where you store your code, history of changes, and other
    important files. There are local repositories on your computer and remote repositories
    on shared servers.

  description:
    Robotic Process Automation is a technology that enables the automation
    of repetitive, rule-based tasks using software robots to perform primarily repetitive
    activities. These robots mimic human actions in digital systems, such as clicking
    buttons, filling out forms, copying and pasting data, accessing systems, and executing
    predefined processes.

    programming language with automatic memory management. Ruby supports functional,
    object-oriented, imperative, and reflective programming. It is like a digital
    toolbox that can create, organize, and make different parts of a computer program
    interact, being able to handle many different programming styles.

  description:
     Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is an open-source tool written in Ruby to create 
    websites and web applications dynamically and efficiently. It organizes development into 
    three main parts':' the data (Model), the user interface (View), 
    and the system logic (Controller)'â€“' a pattern known as MVC.
    Rails is designed to save developers time with its "convention over configuration" philosophy, 
    which provides ready-made standards and reduces the need for manual adjustments. It is a 
    reliable choice for creating fast, scalable, and secure applications, being used by both 
    startups and large companies.
