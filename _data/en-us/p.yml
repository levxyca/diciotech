  description:
    "Pair programming means programming in pairs. It is a technique in
    which two people (or more) work together on a task. This helps in the exchange
    of knowledge and experience between developers. Two heads are better than one,
    right? Some ways to apply pair programming: one person is working on the code
    while receiving guidance from the other and they switch positions; one person
    develops the tests and the other develops the functionality. Don't see pair programming
    as a waste of time. Good integration and a sense of support in the team can make
    all the difference in the quality of what is delivered."

  description:
    A pointer is a programming language data type that stores or refers
    to the memory address of another value located in the computer's memory. A pointer
    refers to a location in memory and gets the value from that location. As such,
    a pointer is a data type that 'points' to a value.

    code: int *pointer; // pointer to an integer in C/C++ language

  description:
    Polymorphism allows objects of different types to behave similarly
    through a shared interface.

  description:
    Also called data preprocessing, it is the process of transforming raw
    data into a format suitable for data analysis. It is generally used to prepare
    data for training machine learning models and thus improve their performance.
    Preprocessing involves several steps, such as data cleaning, normalization, transformation,
    dimensionality reduction, among others.

  description:
    Properties, often abbreviated as 'props', are mechanisms that allow
    you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are used to
    customize the behavior and appearance of a component. For example, when creating
    a button, you can pass properties such as the background color, displayed text,
    and text size as props. Props are crucial to making components reusable and configurable,
    allowing them to adapt to different usage contexts.

    - Versioning
  description:
    It is a change request within a project. This request can be made to
    fix a problem, add a new feature, suggest changes, among other reasons. This change
    request is made so that there is an evaluation of what is being changed within
    the project, understanding whether it makes sense for the context at that moment.
    The request can be pending until people responsible for the project or those who
    have permission approve it. Other rules can be added to these requests, such as
    building the application, running successful tests and whatever else makes sense
    for the project in question.

  description:
    Python is a programming language widely used in web applications, software
    development, data science, and machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because
    it is easy to learn, and it runs on many different platforms.
