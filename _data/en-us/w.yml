    "The WAF (Web Application Firewall) helps protect web applications
    by filtering and monitoring incoming traffic on web applications. It protects
    against the most common types of attacks, such as: cross-site request forgery,
    cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others."
