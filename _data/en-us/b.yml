  description:
    Batch size is a hyperparameter of machine learning models that controls
    the number of examples used in a single run of the model. It is used to control
    how quickly a machine learning model learns and can be tuned to improve its performance.
    A very small batch size during training requires less memory but more iterations
    to complete an epoch, while a larger batch size allows for faster training with
    fewer iterations per epoch but takes up more memory.

  description:
    "A botnet is a network of internet-connected devices infected with
    malware (malware is a malicious program that affects a device), allowing cybercriminals
    to take down websites using this network of devices. The devices can range from
    a computer to an IoT device (an IoT device is a device connected to the internet
    without using cables, for example: smart TVs, smart lamps, smart refrigerators
    and cell phones)."

  description:
    A branch is like a copy of your project at a specific point in time.
    It's like you create a separate version to work on new ideas without touching
    the main version. Each Branch can be edited separately, allowing you to develop
    new things without disturbing the main code.

  description:
    The term Bug is commonly used to inform that there is a problem in
    the program or environment. It can be incorrect or unexpected behavior, usually
    caused by incorrect logic in the code, causing failures during the execution of
    a software.
