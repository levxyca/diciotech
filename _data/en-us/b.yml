  description:
    Batch size is a hyperparameter of machine learning models that controls
    the number of examples used in a single run of the model. It is used to control
    how quickly a machine learning model learns and can be tuned to improve its performance.
    A very small batch size during training requires less memory but more iterations
    to complete an epoch, while a larger batch size allows for faster training with
    fewer iterations per epoch but takes up more memory.

  description:
    Like GitHub, BitBucket is also a source code hosting platform and also
    has integrated CI/CD tools, but it integrates especially well with Atlassian tools,
    such as Jira, and supports Git and Mercurial repositories, while GitHub only supports
    Git.

    "Blue-green deployment is a deployment strategy that consists of having
    a replica of the production environment. New software versions are deployed to
    this replica, and after deployment, user traffic is switched to the environment
    with the new version, thus releasing access to this new version for all users.
    One of its advantages is that, in case of errors in the new version, it is sufficient
    to redirect user requests back to the previous system. To better understand blue-green
    deployment, imagine that you have two kitchens in a restaurant: one blue and one
    green. The blue kitchen is running and serving customers, while you prepare the
    green kitchen. When the green kitchen is ready, you start using it to serve customers.
    If everything goes well, you disable the blue kitchen. If there are problems,
    you can quickly switch back to the blue kitchen."

  description:
    "A botnet is a network of internet-connected devices infected with
    malware (malware is a malicious program that affects a device), allowing cybercriminals
    to take down websites using this network of devices. The devices can range from
    a computer to an IoT device (an IoT device is a device connected to the internet
    without using cables, for example: smart TVs, smart lamps, smart refrigerators
    and cell phones)."

  description:
    A branch is like a copy of your project at a specific point in time.
    It's like you create a separate version to work on new ideas without touching
    the main version. Each Branch can be edited separately, allowing you to develop
    new things without disturbing the main code.

  description:
    The term Bug is commonly used to inform that there is a problem in
    the program or environment. It can be incorrect or unexpected behavior, usually
    caused by incorrect logic in the code, causing failures during the execution of
    a software.
