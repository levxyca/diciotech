  description:
    JSP (JavaServer Pages) is an old technology that allowed the construction
    of HTML pages using the Java language. With it, it was possible to execute business
    logic on the screen, taking Java objects to the front in an easy way. Everything
    was executed by an application server, which translated the code into a final
    HTML before returning to the browser. Nowadays, it is only found in legacy systems.
