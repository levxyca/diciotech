    - Concept
  description:
    An abstraction is a simplification of specific point(s) of some system
    or behavior that we are trying to understand. In programming, we use abstractions
    all the time. This means that we don't need to understand all the deep technical
    details to write code - like the inner workings of a computer. Instead, we can
    use simpler ideas to create our programs.

    - Concept
  description:
    It is a type of machine learning training that uses an adversarial
    model to train a model. In it, two machine learning models are trained in an adversarial
    manner, where one model is responsible for generating fake data and another model
    is responsible for identifying fake data. Adversarial training is used to generate
    realistic fake data, which can be used to augment a training dataset.

    - Concept
  description:
    An algorithm is like a cake recipe for a computer. It is a set of organized
    steps that help solve a problem, such as doing math or analyzing information.
- title: API

    - Concept
  description:
    "API is an acronym that means Application Programming Interface. It
    is a code structure that meets some requirements, following development standards
    and patterns, facilitating the organization of large systems. It provides functionalities
    and information for applications and websites. For example: the Post Office API
    that provides ZIP code and address queries in a simplified manner."
- title: Argument
  tags:
    - Concept
  description:
    An argument is a value or piece of information that you provide to
    a function or method during its call. These arguments are used by the function
    to perform a specific task or to make decisions based on the values provided.
    In short, arguments are input data that allows a function to do its job and produce
    a desired result or perform desired actions.

    - Concept
  description:
    Also called AI, it is a field of computer science that studies how
    computers can simulate human intelligence and cognition. It focuses on developing
    systems capable of performing tasks that could previously only be done by humans,
    such as speech recognition, decision making, language translation, and pattern
    recognition. AI is a broad field that includes several subareas, such as machine
    learning, natural language processing, computer vision, among others.

    - Neural network
  description:
    It is a computational model inspired by the central nervous system
    of an animal, which consists of a set of interconnected processing units, called
    artificial neurons, that simulate the way neurons communicate with each other.
    Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to solve complex and non-linear problems,
    such as pattern recognition, speech recognition, computer vision, among others.

    - Concept
    - Neural network
  description:
    It is a type of artificial neural network composed of two neural networks
    in the encoder-decoder format, being one responsible for encoding input data into
    a latent space and the other for decoding data from a latent space back into the
    input space. It is often used to compress input data in applications such as image
    and video compression, dimensionality reduction, and data augmentation.
- title: Automatic Speech Recognition
  tags:
    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems
    that can analyze and understand human speech, allowing computers to transcribe
    and process audio stimuli into text. Automatic speech recognition and natural
    language processing are related but distinct categories of AI. Automatic speech
    recognition focuses on the process of converting spoken words into text and symbols,
    while NLP is the process of converting text into a structured format that a computer
    can understand and process. Automatic speech recognition is used in a wide variety
    of applications, such as virtual assistants, navigation systems, audio transcription,
    and more.
