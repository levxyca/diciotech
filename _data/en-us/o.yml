  tags:
    - Concept
  description: An object, in software development, is like a character in a video
    game. It has characteristics (data) and can do things (methods). For example,
    a "car" object can have a color, speed and brand (characteristics) and can accelerate,
    brake and turn (actions/methods). Objects are instances of classes and allow you
    to organize code in a way that represents real-world entities, making it more
    understandable and reusable.

    - Paradigm
  description: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is
    based on the idea of modeling software around objects, which are instances of
    classes. Each object contains attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate
    on that data. This allows code to be organized in a more modular, reusable, and
    real-world object-oriented way. OOP promotes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance,
    and polymorphism, facilitating the creation of more flexible, understandable,
    and scalable systems.

    - Concept
  description: Also called an optimization algorithm, it is an algorithm that adjusts
    the parameters of a machine learning model to minimize the loss function. It is
    used to train machine learning models and improve their performance.

    - Concept
  description: Optional Chaining is a feature in JavaScript to handle situations where
    you need to access properties of nested objects but are not sure whether those
    properties actually exist. This helps avoid 'TypeError' errors when trying to
    access something that has not been defined.

  description: Object-relational mapping (ORM) is how we translate tables from a database
    into code, turning them into classes and objects.
- title: Overfitting
  tags:
    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description: This is a problem that occurs when a machine learning model fits training
    data very well, but fails to generalize to new data. This is seen when the model
    performs very well on the metrics for the training data, but performs poorly on
    the test data. Overfitting can be caused by several factors, such as a very complex
    model, a very small training dataset, among others.
