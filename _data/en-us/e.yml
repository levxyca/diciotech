  description:
    It is a machine learning model training technique that stops training
    when the model's performance stops improving. It is used to avoid overfitting
    and generate a model with good performance.

    - Concept
  description:
    It is a vector representation of an object, such as a word, a sentence
    or an image. It is used to represent objects in a more compact and efficient way,
    allowing machine learning models to learn relationships between objects. For example,
    a word can be represented by a vector of real numbers, where each dimension represents
    an attribute of the word, such as gender, number, tense, among others. This vector
    representation can be used as input to a machine learning model, allowing it to
    learn relationships between words, such as synonyms, antonyms, among others.
- title: Encapsulation

    - Concept
  description:
    Encapsulation works like a "magic box" that hides the internal details
    of an object. This means that an object's data and inner workings are kept private
    and cannot be accessed directly from the outside. Instead, the object provides
    controlled interfaces (public methods) for interacting with it. This helps protect
    the object's data and control how it is used, promoting code security and organization.
- title: Environment
  tags:
    - Concept
  description:
    We usually call environment the place or servers where what was developed
    is available for testing, validation, end users to use, or other needs. It can
    be a physical computer or available in the cloud. There are local and dev environments
    (where development is taking place), homolog (or even hom, homol, homologation
    - where tests are usually done), and production (where the final system, developed
    and tested, is available to users).

  tags:
    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    Is a complete iteration of a machine learning model over a training
    data set. Training with a very small number of epochs may not be enough for a
    model to learn, while a very large number may cause overfitting.

    Expo CLI is a tool that makes it easier to develop mobile applications
    for iOS and Android. It is used to quickly create a project with React Native.
