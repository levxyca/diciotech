- title: Named parameter
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: It is a way to pass values to a function or method by specifying the
    name of the corresponding parameter.
- title: Natural Language Processing
  tags:
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Concept
  description: Also known as NLP, it is a field of artificial intelligence that studies
    how computers can understand and interpret human language. It focuses on developing
    systems that can analyze, understand, and generate natural language, allowing
    computers to process and respond to written information. NLP is used in a wide
    variety of applications, such as chatbots, machine translation, sentiment analysis,
    among others.
- title: Neural Architecture Search
  tags:
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Concept
  description: Neural Architecture Search or NAS is an optimization process that uses
    search algorithms to find the best neural network architecture for a given dataset.
    It is used to find the best neural network architecture to solve a given problem,
    improving performance and reducing training time compared to manually searching
    for the best architecture.
- title: Next.js
  tags:
  - Framework
  - Front-end
  description: Next.js is a tool based on React that helps create faster and more
    SEO-friendly websites. It allows pages to be generated on the server (SSR) or
    created statically (SSG), which improves page loading time and user experience.
- title: Node.js
  tags:
  - Back-end
  description: Node.js is an environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the
    server. This means that you can use JavaScript to create and run server-side applications.
- title: Non-Linearity Function
  tags:
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Concept
  description: Also called an activation function, it is a mathematical function that
    is applied to the output of neurons in an artificial neural network. It is used
    to introduce nonlinearities into an artificial neural network by changing the
    output value of each neuron in a layer before sending it to the next layer, allowing
    the network to learn complex relationships between the input data and the output
    data. For example, the most commonly used nonlinearity function is the ReLU (Rectified
    Linear Unit) function, which returns 0 if the input value is negative and returns
    the input value itself otherwise.
- title: Normalization
  tags:
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Concept
  description: It is a data processing technique used to transform data into a common
    scale. It is used to improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing
    variance and training time. There are several normalization techniques, such as
    batch normalization, layer normalization, weight normalization, among others.
- title: NoSQL
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a database approach that allows you to store,
    retrieve, and manage data in a flexible and scalable way, without the rigid structure
    of relational tables, being suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- title: Null Coalescence
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: Logical operator that allows you to handle null values, returning the
    value on the right if the value on the left is null.
