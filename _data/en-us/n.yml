  id: natural_language_processing
  description: Also known as NLP, it is a field of artificial intelligence that studies
    how computers can understand and interpret human language. It focuses on developing
    systems that can analyze, understand, and generate natural language, allowing
    computers to process and respond to written information. NLP is used in a wide
    variety of applications, such as chatbots, machine translation, sentiment analysis,
    among others.

  id: neural_architecture_search
  description: Neural Architecture Search or NAS is an optimization process that uses
    search algorithms to find the best neural network architecture for a given dataset.
    It is used to find the best neural network architecture to solve a given problem,
    improving performance and reducing training time compared to manually searching
    for the best architecture.

  id: next_js
  description: Next.js is a tool based on React that helps create faster and more
    SEO-friendly websites. It allows pages to be generated on the server (SSR) or
    created statically (SSG), which improves page loading time and user experience.

  id: non_linearity_function
  description: Also called an activation function, it is a mathematical function that
    is applied to the output of neurons in an artificial neural network. It is used
    to introduce nonlinearities into an artificial neural network by changing the
    output value of each neuron in a layer before sending it to the next layer, allowing
    the network to learn complex relationships between the input data and the output
    data. For example, the most commonly used nonlinearity function is the ReLU (Rectified
    Linear Unit) function, which returns 0 if the input value is negative and returns
    the input value itself otherwise.

  id: normalization
  description: It is a data processing technique used to transform data into a common
    scale. It is used to improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing
    variance and training time. There are several normalization techniques, such as
    batch normalization, layer normalization, weight normalization, among others.

    - Concept
  id: nosql
  description: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a database approach that allows you to store,
    retrieve, and manage data in a flexible and scalable way, without the rigid structure
    of relational tables, being suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.
