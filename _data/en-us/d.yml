    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    It is a data preprocessing technique used to increase the size of a
    training dataset available to a machine learning model by generating new data
    based on the existing data, which improves its performance and reduces the risk
    of overfitting. For example, an image dataset can be augmented using rotations,
    zooms, mirrorings, and other geometric transformations.

    - Concept
  description:
    A dataset is a set of data that can be used to train and test machine
    learning models. Different parts of the dataset are typically used for training
    and testing to avoid overfitting. Parts can also be used for validation and inference.
    A dataset is made up of several examples, which in turn are made up of several
    data points. For example, a cat dataset might contain several examples of cats,
    where each example might be made up of one or more images and several associated
    attributes, such as size, breed, and color.

    - Concept
  description:
    DBMS (Database Management System) is a type of system that allows the
    user to manage databases, performing operations such as creating and modifying
    tables, allowing access for users, among others. We can say, for example, that
    MySQL is a DBMS.

  description:
    DDoS is an attack where many devices try to connect to a website at
    the same time to overload it.

  tags:
    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    Deep Learning or DL is a subset of machine learning that uses deep
    artificial neural networks to learn representations of complex data. Due to the
    multiple layers present in a deep neural network, deep learning tends to be much
    more time-consuming than traditional machine learning, but tends to offer higher
    performance, efficiency, and accuracy. Deep learning is one of the most advanced
    areas of artificial intelligence.

    - Neural network
  description:
    Deep Neural Network or DNN is a type of artificial neural network with
    several layers of interconnected processing units. It is called a deep neural
    network due to the number of hidden layers used in the deep learning model. While
    a basic neural network is made up of an input layer, an output layer and a few
    intermediate layers (also called hidden layers), a deep neural network has several
    hidden processing layers, which can reach thousands. These additional layers give
    these networks the ability to make predictions with greater accuracy when compared
    to a simpler neural network, but they require millions of sample data points and
    hundreds of hours of training.
- title: Deploy
  tags:
    - Concept
  description:
    Deployment is a complex process. But it means that a package of what
    was developed in the environments was installed. A version is generated to be
    made available. For this deployment to happen, it can be an automated process
    with tools, or done manually, depending on the structure.
- title: Design Critique
  tags:
    - Design
  description:
    It is a collaborative process where designers, developers and other
    stakeholders review and evaluate a design project or concept in a constructive
    way. The goal is to obtain valuable feedback on the aesthetic effectiveness, functionality,
    and usability of the design, allowing to identify strengths and areas of improvement.
    During the process, participants discuss aspects such as visual coherence, user
    experience and adherence to product goals and technical feasibility, promoting
    an open environment where ideas can be shared. This process not only improves
    the final result, but also strengthens collaboration and learning within the team.
- title: Design Ops

    - Design
  description:
    A practice that optimizes and integrates the design process in digital
    product development teams, promoting collaboration between designers, developers
    and stakeholders. It implements frameworks, tools, and processes that improve
    the efficiency, consistency, and quality of design. The focus is to create a structured
    environment that allows designers to focus on the tasks at hand, while operational
    aspects, such as documentation and resource management, are managed effectively.
    This aligns design goals with business objectives, resulting in more cohesive
    and well-designed digital products.

    - Front-end
  description:
    "It is a set of guidelines, components, and standards that guide the
    creation and maintenance of consistent user interfaces and experiences in digital
    products. It includes elements such as: color palettes, typography, icons, and
    layout standards, in addition to being a documentation for designers and developers
    on how and when to use the design system components. It aims to improve development
    efficiency, ensure visual and functional coherence, and facilitate collaboration
    between design and development teams."

  tags:
    - Concept
  description:
    It is a practice that integrates software development (Dev) and IT
    operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and efficiency between teams. It focuses
    on automation and the integration of development, testing, and deployment processes,
    enabling faster and higher-quality releases. The approach emphasizes continuous
    communication, continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery (CD), promoting
    an agile and responsive development lifecycle, resulting in software delivered
    more efficiently and reliably.

  tags:
    - Front-end
  description:
    A representation of the tree structure of HTML elements on a page,
    which allows dynamic manipulation of content. Think of it as a map of the page
    that JavaScript uses to understand and change the content. It's like a 'blueprint'
    of the page.
- title: Domain Adaptation
  tags:
    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    It is the ability to apply an algorithm trained on one or more 'source
    domains' to a different but related 'target domain'. Domain adaptation is a subcategory
    of transfer learning. In domain adaptation, the source and target domains all
    have the same feature space (but different distributions), while transfer learning
    includes cases where the feature space of the target domain is different. For
    example, a spam filtering model trained on data from one user can be adapted to
    a new user who receives completely different emails.

    DoS is a denial of service attack. In this attack a single computer
    is used to make many queries to a website in a short space of time with the aim
    of taking it offline.
