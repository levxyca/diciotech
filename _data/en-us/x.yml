  description:
    XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines
    a set of rules for encoding documents. It is a markup language like HTML, but
    XML was created to be more flexible, allowing the creation of new tags, while
    HTML has a limited number of predefined tags. It is a generic language that can
    be used to represent any type of structured data. XML is a very popular language,
    being used in databases, system configuration files, information transmission,
    among others.
