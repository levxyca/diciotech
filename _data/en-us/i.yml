    to inherit characteristics and behaviors from another parent class. This means
    that the child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class,
    saving time and promoting code reuse. Inheritance is a way to organize and structure
    code by creating class hierarchies that represent relationships between real-world
    objects.
