    with graphical interfaces that facilitate the interaction of developers in the
    creation of applications. Typically an IDE includes a source code editor and debugging
    tools to identify and correct errors. Popular examples of IDEs include Android
    Studio, Eclipse, and Visual Studio Code.

  description: "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of building infrastructure
    (such as resources within a cloud provider) through coding, just as we do when
    developing software. To code the infrastructure, tools like Terraform are used.
    The infrastructure code is versioned and can be kept separate or together with
    the application code that will use this infrastructure later. Infrastructure as
    Code is like a detailed recipe book for cooks: instead of giving verbal instructions,
    you write everything in the book, ensuring that everyone follows exactly the same
    instructions and prepares the dishes consistently and accurately. This reduces
    errors and facilitates environment replication."

  description: Inheritance works like a "family tree". It allows a class or object
    to inherit characteristics and behaviors from another parent class. This means
    that the child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class,
    saving time and promoting code reuse. Inheritance is a way to organize and structure
    code by creating class hierarchies that represent relationships between real-world
    objects.

  description: IoT (Internet of Things) is a type of technology composed of a network
    of interconnected devices and objects, such as sensors, cameras, household items,
    electronic devices, and vehicles, for example. Its goal is basically to connect
    the most diverse equipment to the internet in order to capture and exchange data
    with other devices, ranging from simple household objects to sophisticated industrial
    tools.
