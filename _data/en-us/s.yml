  tags:
    - Back-end
  id: scrum
  description: It is a method of managing projects where work is broken down into
    small chunks called 'sprints', which typically last a few weeks. The team works
    closely together, meeting regularly to plan, review, and adjust work. The goal
    is to deliver value quickly and iteratively, responding to changes and feedback
    as the project progresses.

  id: semi_supervised_learning
  description: It is a type of machine learning that uses labeled and unlabeled data
    to train a model. It is widely used to solve classification problems of large
    data sets, where the goal is to predict an output value based on a set of input
    values. Semi-supervised training is used when there is a large set of unlabeled
    data and a small set of labeled data, and is more efficient than supervised training
    and more accurate than unsupervised training.

  description: Smart cities are locations that use organized urban infrastructure
    and digital technologies to optimize their processes. This includes the use of
    devices with Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, among others.

    - Concept
  id: solid
  description: "The SOLID principles are five guidelines for object-oriented software
    design, promoting more flexible, robust and maintainable systems. They are: Single
    Responsibility Principle (a class should have only one responsibility), Open/Closed
    Principle (classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification),
    Liskov Substitution Principle (subclasses should be replaceable by their superclasses
    without changing the correctness of the program), Interface Segregation Principle
    (classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use) and Dependency
    Inversion Principle (high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules;
    both should depend on abstractions)."

  id: spread_operator
  description: The spread operator is an operator that is present in several programming
    languages, which allows copying and combining elements from one data structure
    into another, facilitating the efficient manipulation of information.

  description: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage
    data in relational databases. It's like a language that allows us to talk to databases
    to do things like search, add, update, and delete information.

  description: In the context of React Native, it is a navigation technique between
    the application's screens, when the application has back and forward buttons,
    for example.
- title: Stateful Widget

    - Mobile
  id: stateful_widget
  description: A StatefulWidget, in Flutter, is a component that has mutable internal
    state, allowing it to respond to state changes and dynamically update the user
    interface.

    - Mobile
  id: stateless_widget
  description: A StatelessWidget, in Flutter, is a component that has no internal
    mutable state, ideal for parts of the user interface that do not change over time
    and do not rely on state.
- title: Style Guide
  tags:
    - Design
  id: style_guide
  description: It is a library that brings together style guidelines and visual standards
    for the creation of digital products. It includes elements such as typography,
    color palettes, use of icons and layouts, but does not cover technical aspects
    such as code. The objective of a style guide is to ensure visual consistency and
    coherence in brand communication, serving as a reference for designers and marketing
    and communication teams, but without the direct collaboration of developers.
- title: Supervised Learning

    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  id: supervised_learning
  description: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses labeled
    data to train a model. It is used to solve classification and regression problems,
    where the goal is to predict an output value based on a set of input values. For
    example, a machine learning model can be trained to classify images of cats and
    dogs, where the training dataset consists of images of cats and dogs labeled as
    such. Supervised training is one of the most common types of machine learning
    and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.

  id: swiftui
  description: SwiftUI is an Apple tool for creating the visual part of applications
    using the Swift language. Unlike UIKit, which is more traditional, SwiftUI allows
    you to describe the user interface in a simpler and more direct way, making it
    easier to both create and maintain your code.
