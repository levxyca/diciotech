  description: It is the process of creating the visual and interactive part of a
    digital product, such as a website or an application. This includes the design
    of buttons, menus, icons, and the entire look and feel of the layout, ensuring
    that it is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. The goal of UI Design
    is to make users feel comfortable and attracted to the look of the product, applying
    colors, typography and visual elements that align with the brand identity.

  description: It is a problem that occurs when a machine learning model does not
    fit well on the training data and cannot generalize to new data. This is seen
    when the model performs poorly on both the training data and the test data. Underfitting
    can be caused by several factors, such as a model that is too simple, a training
    dataset that is too small, among others.

  description: It is a type of machine learning that uses unlabeled data to train
    a model. It is used to solve clustering problems, where the goal is to find patterns
    in a dataset. For example, a machine learning model can be trained to cluster
    images of cats and dogs, where the training dataset consists of images of cats
    and dogs without associated labels. The model is then responsible for finding
    patterns in the data and clustering the data according to those patterns, independent
    of any other information.

  description: It is the process of creating products and services that offer a positive
    and efficient experience for users. This involves understanding the needs and
    behaviors of the people who will use the product, to ensure that it is easy to
    use, accessible and enjoyable. The goal is to make the user's interaction with
    the product intuitive, helping to solve problems and meet expectations, from the
    first contact to continued use. It is about designing experiences that make users
    feel satisfied and engaged with the product.
