    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    Also called annotated data, this is data that has a label or tag that
    indicates what it represents. It is used to train supervised or semi-supervised
    machine learning models, where the goal is to predict an output value based on
    a set of input values. For example, a dataset of images of cats and dogs might
    be labeled with the class of each image, allowing a machine learning model to
    be trained to classify images of cats and dogs.

    - Concept
  description:
    Lambda is an anonymous function in programming that can be defined
    and used without a specific name, often used for simple one-line expressions.

    code: "sum = lambda x, y: x + y"

    - Back-end
    - Framework
  description:
    Laravel is a tool for developing web systems in PHP. It offers ways
    to deal with common needs in this type of application, as well as having simplified
    integration with various database systems, queues, and others.

    - Concept
  description:
    Also called LLM, it is a language model that uses deep learning to
    learn representations of natural language data. It is trained on massive sets
    of textual data, such as books, news articles, and web pages, and is capable of
    interpreting and generating high-quality text. Large language models are used
    as baseline models for a variety of natural language applications, such as machine
    translation, text summarization, code generation, and more.
- title: Latent Space

    - Concept
  description:
    Also called latent feature space or embedding space, it is a vector
    space (manifold) that can be generated from the training of a machine learning
    model. A position within this space is defined by a set of latent variables that
    emerge from the similarities of objects, so that items that resemble each other
    are positioned closer together. In many cases, the dimensionality of the latent
    space is chosen to be smaller than the dimensionality of the input data space,
    making the construction of this space an example of dimensionality reduction,
    which can also be seen as a form of data compression. The latent space can be
    completely unintuitive, high-dimensional, complex, and non-linear, which can increase
    the difficulty of interpretation. Some visualization techniques have been developed
    to connect the latent space to the visual world, but there is usually no direct
    connection between the interpretation of the latent space and the model itself
    that generated it. Among these techniques is t-SNE, in which the latent space
    is mapped to two or three dimensions for visualization. Distances in latent space
    do not have physical units, so the interpretation of these distances can depend
    on the application.

    - Concept
  description:
    Also called LR, it is a training hyperparameter for machine learning
    models that controls how quickly a machine learning model learns. It is one of
    the most important hyperparameters of a machine learning model and can be adjusted
    to improve the model's performance. It controls how big the step will be taken
    during learning towards the minimum calculated by the gradient. A very high learning
    rate can cause the gradient to explode, while a very low learning rate can cause
    the gradient to disappear. There are several techniques that allow you to change
    the learning rate during training, such as learning rate decay, learning rate
    scheduling, learning rate warming, among others.
- title: Load balancer
  tags:
    - Concept
  description:
    "A load balancer is a tool used to distribute the load (of user requests,
    for example) among multiple servers. The goal of using a load balancer is to improve
    the performance of applications, avoiding overload on a single server. In addition,
    a load balancer can help us scale a system and ensure its high availability. To
    better understand the concept, let's think of a supermarket queue: if we had
    only one cashier to serve us, this cashier would probably be overloaded with so
    many people trying to pay for their purchases. In this case, people are directed
    to different cashiers to avoid a bottleneck and a long wait time at a single cashier."

    - Concept
  description:
    A loop is a control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute
    a block of code while a condition is true. It is used to automate repetitive tasks
    and save time and effort. There are several types of loops, such as the 'for'
    loop, the 'while' loop, and the 'do-while' loop.
- title: Loss Function
  tags:
    - Artificial intelligence
    - Concept
  description:
    It is a mathematical function that measures the difference between
    the value predicted by a machine learning model and the actual value of the training
    data. It is used to evaluate the accuracy of a machine learning model and adjust
    its parameters to improve its performance. There are several types of loss functions,
    each suited to a different type of machine learning problem.

  description:
    A programming language that has little or no computer abstraction.
    It is a programming language that is closest to machine language.
