  description: Vanishing gradient is a problem that occurs when the gradient of a
    loss function decreases exponentially during the training of a machine learning
    model. As the gradients often become smaller until they are close to zero, the
    new weights calculated by the model will be virtually identical to the old weights,
    without any updates. As a result, the gradient descent algorithm never converges
    to the optimal solution and the model stops learning. Vanishing gradient can be
    caused by several factors, such as a very low learning rate, a poorly designed
    loss function, among others.

  description: Vue.js is a JavaScript tool used to create user interfaces, that is,
    what people see and interact with on a website or application. It is easy to add
    to existing projects and is widely used to build sites that function as a single
    page (SPAs).
