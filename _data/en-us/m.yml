  description: Machine Learning or ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI)
    that studies how computers can learn from and make predictions about data, without
    being explicitly programmed. Most AI is done with machine learning, so the two
    terms are often used synonymously, but machine learning is just one method used
    for this. It is used to solve complex problems and automate tasks that would be
    too time-consuming or impossible for humans.

  description: In differential geometry, a manifold is a high-dimensional topological
    space (surface) that locally resembles Euclidean space. In machine learning, a
    manifold is a latent feature space that can be generated from training a machine
    learning model. The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data (e.g.,
    real-world data like images and videos) are contained in a low-dimensional space,
    where relationships between the data are more easily identified. The idea is that
    by mapping the data to a low-dimensional space, it is possible to find patterns
    and relationships more easily than in the original high-dimensional space.

  description: Material.io is a design system created and supported by Google's designers
    and developers. Material.io includes detailed UX guidelines and UI component implementations
    for Android, Flutter, and the web.
- title: Memory Address

  - Concept
  description: It is a number that uniquely identifies a memory location in the computer.
    Everything that is declared in a programming language is stored in the computer's
    memory, and to access this data it is necessary to know the memory address where
    it is stored.

  - Versioning
  description: Merge is like putting together puzzle pieces in code development. It's
    when we combine changes from different parts of the code to create a unified version.
    Imagine merging the work of a team that added new features back into the main
    project. That's Merge - bringing it all together into a single line of development.

  - Concept
  description: Also called an evaluation metric, it is a measure used to evaluate
    the accuracy or performance of a machine learning model. There are several types
    of metrics, each suited to a different type of problem.
- title: MLOps
  tags:
  - Concept
  description: It is a practice that combines machine learning model development and
    IT operations (Ops) to facilitate the implementation and continuous management
    of machine learning models in production. The goal of MLOps is to ensure that
    models are developed, tested, deployed, and monitored efficiently and at scale.
    This involves automating processes such as model training, validation, and monitoring,
    as well as promoting collaboration between data scientists, software engineers,
    and operations teams. MLOps aims to reduce development cycle time and increase
    model reliability and performance, enabling organizations to better leverage data-driven
    insights.
