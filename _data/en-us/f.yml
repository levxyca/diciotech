  description:
    It is a type of machine learning that uses few labeled data to train
    a model. In it, a machine learning model (usually pre-trained) is trained with
    new labeled data, containing few examples per class. Few-shot learning is widely
    used to solve classification problems on small data sets.

    - Concept
  description:
    Is the process of training a pre-trained machine learning model on
    a new dataset. It is used to adapt a base model for a specific task, improving
    its performance and reducing training time compared to training from scratch.
    Fine-tuning is commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing
    models.

    - Versioning
  description:
    Forking is like creating an independent copy of a project. It's like
    taking someone else's project, copying it, and having it in your own account.
    This allows you to make your own changes without touching the original project.
    This is common in open source projects.

  description:
    Also called base models, these are machine learning models that are
    pre-trained on large datasets and are commonly made available for use by third
    parties. They are used as base models for various applications in computer vision,
    natural language processing, among others. Foundation models can be used frozen,
    as a feature extraction layer, or fine-tuned, generating a complete model.

    - Framework
  description:
    They are like collections of tools, components and solutions that you
    can find in the same package (the framework) that facilitate the creation of complex
    applications.

  description:
    Front-end development is the development of the graphical interface,
    so that users can view and interact with what has been developed.
- title: Function
  tags:
    - Concept
  description:
    A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can
    be called from other parts of the program. It helps organize and reuse code, making
    software more modular and readable. Functions may take inputs (called arguments)
    and can return a result (return value) or simply perform an action.
